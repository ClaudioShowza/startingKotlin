Complete the code to make the program print "Mary is 20 years old" to standard output:

fun main() {
    val name = "Mary"
    val age = 20
    println("$name is $age years old")
}

Explicitly declare the correct type for each variable:

fun main() {
    val a: Int = 1000
    val b: String = "log message"
    val c: Double = 3.14
    val d: Long = 100_000_000_000
    val e: Boolean = false
    val f: Char = '\n'
}


You have a list of “green” numbers and a list of “red” numbers. Complete the code to print how many numbers there are in total:

fun main() {
    val greenNumbers = listOf(1, 4, 23)
    val redNumbers = listOf(17, 2)
    val totalCount = greenNumbers.count() + redNumbers.count()
    println(totalCount)
}

You have a set of protocols supported by your server. A user requests to use a particular protocol. Complete the program to check whether the requested protocol is supported or not (isSupported must be a Boolean value):

fun main() {
    val SUPPORTED = setOf("HTTP", "HTTPS", "FTP")
    val requested = "smtp"
    val isSupported = requested.uppercase() in SUPPORTED
    println("Support for $requested: $isSupported")
}

Define a map that relates integer numbers from 1 to 3 to their corresponding spelling. Use this map to spell the given number:

fun main() {
    val number2word = mapOf(1 to "one", 2 to "two", 3 to "three")
    val n = 2
    println("$n is spelt as '${number2word[n]}'")
}
